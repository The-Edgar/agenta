These clauses typically include language such as:\n\n- \"indemnify,\" \"defend,\" \"hold harmless\"\n- References to third-party claims\n- Obligations to cover damages, losses, liabilities, costs, or expenses\n- Provisions related to intellectual property infringement\n- General indemnification for breaches of contract\n- Personal injury or property damage indemnification\n\n## What Constitutes a Limitation of Liability Clause\n\nLimitation of liability clauses are contractual provisions that restrict or cap one party's financial exposure for damages, losses, or liabilities arising under the agreement. These clauses typically include language such as:\n\n- **Monetary caps:** \"liability shall not exceed,\" \"limited to [X] dollars,\" \"capped at,\" \"maximum liability\"\n- **Exclusions of damage types:** \"in no event liable for,\" \"excludes,\" \"shall not be liable for consequential, indirect, incidental, special, punitive damages\"\n- **Carve-outs/exceptions:** \"except for,\" \"excluding,\" \"nothing in this section limits liability for\"\n- **Aggregate vs. per-incident caps:** \"aggregate liability,\" \"total cumulative liability,\" \"per claim,\" \"per incident\"\n- **Direct damages only:** \"limited to direct damages,\" \"actual damages incurred\"\n- **Time limitations:** \"claims must be brought within,\" \"no liability after [X] months/years\"\n"

Do not limit your search to specific sections titled \"Indemnification\" or \"Limitation of Liability\"—these clauses can appear anywhere in the document.\n\n2. **Identify all limitation of liability clauses** using the definition and language patterns provided in the CONTEXT section.\n\n3. **Identify all indemnity clauses** using the definition and language patterns provided in the CONTEXT section.\n\n4. Number each finding sequentially as you encounter them in the contract (e.g., Finding #1, Finding #2, etc.).\n\n## Analysis and Comparison\n\n5. For each identified clause, **compare the language against the applicable playbook rules** provided by the user.\n\n6. **Determine compliance:** Does the clause comply with all playbook requirements, or does it contain non-compliant language, terms, or provisions?\n\n## Rewriting with Minimal Word Changes\n\n7. **For non-compliant clauses only**, rewrite the clause to align with playbook requirements using the **minimal word changes approach:**\n\n- **Preserve structure:** Keep the original sentence structure, clause numbering, and organization wherever possible.\n- **Change only what's necessary:** Edit only the specific words, phrases, or terms that violate playbook requirements.\n- **Keep everything else identical:** Do not rephrase, restructure, or modify compliant language.\n- **When full sentences need editing:** If a sentence is fundamentally non-compliant and requires substantial revision to meet playbook standards, edit the entire sentence.\n- **Show changes clearly:** Use markdown formatting to indicate:\n    - **~~Strikethrough~~** for deleted text\n    - **Bold** for added text\n\n8. **Ensure full playbook implementation:** Despite minimizing changes, you must ensure that ALL playbook requirements are fully implemented in the rewritten clause. Do not sacrifice compliance for minimalism.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n9. For each finding, assign a **risk level** (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) based on:\n- **HIGH:** Uncapped or unlimited liability, broad \"alleged\" claims without judicial determination, scope covering all breaches or general negligence, exposure to indirect/consequential damages without limits\n- **MEDIUM:** Some limitations present but insufficient (e.g., higher caps than playbook allows, missing certain protections, broader fault standards than required)\n- **LOW:** Minor non-compliance (e.g., missing specific language, needs clarification, but overall exposure is limited)\n\n10. Provide a **one-line risk statement** describing the specific risk created by the non-compliant language.\n\n## Explanation\n\n11. For each finding, provide a **brief reason for change** (2-4 sentences) explaining:\n    - What specific playbook requirement was violated\n    - What changes were made to address the violation\n    - How the rewritten clause now complies with playbook standards\n\n---"

Company agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Blackhawk harmless from and against any and all damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Blackhawk as a result of any claim, judgment or proceeding against Blackhawk: (a) allegedly related to, arising out of or in connection with the Services and/or Deliverables hereunder; or (b) by reason of any breach or alleged breach or failure of any of the covenants, representations, warranties, or obligations of Company under this Agreement.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n2.1 General Indemnification. Company agrees to defend, indemnify, and hold Blackhawk harmless from and against ~~any and all~~ **damages awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction arising from third-party claims** ~~damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses (including without limitation, litigation costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Blackhawk as a result of any claim, judgment or proceeding against Blackhawk:~~ **to the extent such damages result from:** (a) ~~allegedly related to, arising out of or in connection with the Services and/or Deliverables hereunder~~ **Company's gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of Services; or** (b) ~~by reason of any~~ **Company's** breach ~~or alleged breach or failure~~ of ~~any of the covenants, representations, warranties, or~~ **its** obligations under **Section [X] (Intellectual Property), Section [Y] (Confidentiality), Section [Z] (Data Protection), or Section [W] (Security) of** this Agreement**. Company's total liability under this indemnification shall be capped at five (5) times the fees paid or payable under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the claim.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated multiple playbook requirements: it covered \"allegedly related to\" claims without requiring court determination, included all types of breaches without limitation to specific categories, used overly broad causation language (\"arising out of or in connection with\"), and lacked any monetary cap. The rewrite limits indemnification to court-awarded damages from third-party claims, restricts scope to the four acceptable categories (IP, confidentiality, data protection, security) plus gross negligence/willful misconduct, changes causation to \"to the extent arising from,\" and implements the required 5× cap.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** HIGH - Uncapped liability for any alleged claims without judicial determination, creating unlimited exposure across all potential breaches.\n\n---\n\n## Example Output 2: Indemnity Clause (Personal Injury)\n\n### Finding #2\n\n**Clause Type:** Indemnity\n\n**Original Clause:**\n```\n7.2. Personal Injury and Damage to Property. Vendor agrees to indemnify Forescout, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents for any liability or expense due to claims for personal injury or damage to property arising out of the furnishing or performance of any services provided hereunder or arising out of the fault or negligence of Vendor.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n7.2. Personal Injury and Damage to Property. Vendor agrees to indemnify Forescout~~, its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents~~ for ~~any liability or expense~~ **damages awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction** due to **third-party** claims for personal injury**, death,** or damage to **tangible** property ~~arising out of~~ **to the extent arising from** the furnishing or performance of ~~any~~ services provided hereunder ~~or arising out of~~ **and caused by** the ~~fault or~~ **Vendor's gross** negligence **or willful misconduct**~~of Vendor~~**. Vendor's total liability under this indemnification shall be capped at five (5) times the fees paid or payable under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the claim.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated playbook requirements by holding Vendor liable for general \"fault\" and \"negligence\" (broader than gross negligence/willful misconduct), covering affiliates (should exclude), lacking specificity on third-party claims and court-awarded damages, using broad causation language (\"arising out of\"), and having no monetary cap. The rewrite limits to gross negligence/willful misconduct, excludes affiliates, adds \"third-party claims\" and \"court-awarded damages\" requirements, clarifies \"personal injury\" includes death and \"property\" means tangible property, changes causation to \"to the extent arising from,\" and implements the 5× cap.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - Liability extends to general negligence and fault without cap, though scope is somewhat limited to personal injury/property damage which is more defined than general contract breaches.\n\n---\n\n## Example Output 3: Limitation of Liability Clause\n\n### Finding #3\n\n**Clause Type:** Limitation of Liability\n\n**Original Clause:**\n```\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 8.1. Except as expressly provided in Section 8.2, in no event shall either party's aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether arising out of or related to breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, exceed the total amount paid or payable by Client to Vendor under this Agreement in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date the claim arose.\n\n8.2. The limitations in Section 8.1 shall not apply to: (a) either party's indemnification obligations under Section 7; (b) Vendor's breach of Section 4 (Confidentiality); (c) Vendor's infringement or misappropriation of Client's Intellectual Property Rights; or (d) either party's gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 8.1. ~~Except as expressly provided in Section 8.2, in~~ **In** no event shall either party's aggregate liability **for direct damages only** arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether arising out of or related to breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, exceed ~~the total amount~~ **150% of the fees** paid or payable by Client to Vendor under this Agreement **during** the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the date the claim arose**. Neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, business, goodwill, data, or pure economic loss, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.**\n\n8.2. The limitations in Section 8.1 shall not apply to: (a) ~~either party's indemnification obligations under Section 7~~ **mandatory legal carve-outs for (i) death or personal injury caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct, (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, or (iii) liability that cannot be excluded or limited by law**; (b) **Vendor's** ~~either party's indemnification obligations under Section 7; (b) Vendor's~~ breach of Section 4 (Confidentiality); (c) Vendor's infringement or misappropriation of Client's Intellectual Property Rights; or (d) ~~either party's gross negligence or willful misconduct~~ **Vendor's breach of data protection or security obligations**. **For claims under subsections (b), (c), and (d), Vendor's aggregate liability shall be capped at five (5) times the fees paid or payable under this Agreement during the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the claim.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated playbook requirements by: (1) lacking a specific cap percentage (should be 150% of fees, not \"total amount\"), (2) not explicitly restricting to direct damages only, (3) not explicitly excluding indirect/consequential damages, (4) allowing unlimited liability for all indemnification obligations (should have finite cap), (5) not specifying the mandatory legal carve-outs, (6) allowing unlimited liability for gross negligence/willful misconduct, and (7) not capping the carve-out exceptions. The rewrite implements the 150% cap for general liability, adds explicit direct damages restriction and consequential damages exclusion, replaces unlimited indemnification exception with specific 5× capped categories (confidentiality, IP, data protection/security), adds mandatory legal carve-outs, and removes the unlimited gross negligence exception.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** HIGH - Multiple unlimited liability exposures including all indemnification obligations and gross negligence/willful misconduct without any finite cap, plus missing explicit exclusions for consequential damages.\n\n---"
