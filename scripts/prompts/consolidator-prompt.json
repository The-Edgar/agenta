Compare all suggested edits character-by-character\n2. Apply Priority Rules to resolve conflicts\n3. Combine non-conflicting edits from all analyses\n4. Ensure the merged result includes:\n   - All necessary deletions (~~strikethrough~~)\n   - All necessary additions (**bold**)\n   - Proper markdown formatting\n   - Coherent, readable final text\n\n## Step 3: Preserve Unique Findings\n\n- Findings with no overlaps pass through unchanged\n- Maintain original formatting and structure\n\n## Step 4: Verify Consistency\n\n- Check that definitions are used consistently\n- Ensure cross-references between clauses remain valid\n- Verify that combined edits don't create contradictions"
