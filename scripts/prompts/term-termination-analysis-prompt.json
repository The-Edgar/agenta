				"content": "# CONTEXT\n## What Constitutes a Contract Duration and Termination Clauses\n**Contract Duration and Termination Clauses** are provisions that together define the **temporal scope**, **continuity**, and **ending conditions** of a contract. They establish when the Agreement begins, how long it remains in force, how associated works or services run in relation to that period, and under what circumstances the Agreement or any related work may be terminated and what must be done once the contract has terminated.\nThese clauses typically serve two connected purposes:\n1. The **Duration or Term** clause governs the **start, length, renewal, and continuity** of the contractual relationship; and\n2. The **Termination** clause governs **how and when that relationship (or parts of it)** may be ended, and the **effects** of such termination.\n### **Duration (or Term) Component**\nThe Duration section defines when the contract begins and how long it lasts. It should specify the Effective Date, the Initial Term, any Renewal Terms (if applicable), and the relationship between the overarching Agreement and any subordinate documents such as Statements of Work (SOWs) or Project Orders or Schedules.\nIn some agreements—typically one-off or project-based engagements—the duration of the works and the Agreement itself are concurrent.\nIn framework or master service agreements (MSAs), however, the main Agreement may run independently, with individual SOWs beginning and ending at different times under its umbrella.\n**Typical wording indicators include:**\n- **Term definitions:** “Term,” “Duration,” “Agreement Term,” “Commencement and Termination,” “Effective Date,” “Duration of Agreement.”\n- **Commencement language:** “shall commence on,” “effective as of,” “beginning on,” “starts on.”\n- **Duration specifications:** “shall continue for,” “fixed term of,” “period of [X] years,” “until completion.”\n- **Evergreen provisions:** “shall continue in effect until terminated,” “perpetual,” “ongoing.”\n- **Renewal terms:** “automatic renewal,” “renews for successive periods,” “unless terminated.”\n- **SOW/Project references:** “Statement of Work,” “each SOW shall have its own term,” “project completion.”\n\n### **Termination Component**\nThe Termination section defines the **conditions and mechanisms** under which the Agreement or any part of it (including individual SOWs) may be brought to an end, and the **consequences** that follow.\nTermination provisions may appear as a dedicated clause or combined with the duration section under a heading such as *“Term and Termination.”*\n**Common headings and keywords include:**\n“Termination,” “Expiry,” “Termination for Cause,” “Termination for Convenience,” “Early Termination,” “Insolvency,” “Bankruptcy,” “Term and Termination,” “Effect of Termination,” “Refunds,” “Termination Assistance,” “Consequences of Termination,” “Transition.”\n**Typical functions include:**\n- **Termination for cause:** Rights of either Party to terminate immediately for unremedied material breach, persistent breach, insolvency, or (in some cases) detrimental change of control.\n- **Termination for convenience:** Ability to terminate on notice without breach (usually restricted to renewal periods and only when no active SOWs are in effect).\n- **Notice periods:** Specifying the written notice required to effect termination.\n- **Consequences of termination:** Defining refund rights, final payments, ongoing obligations, and survival of key provisions.\n- **Termination assistance:** Post-termination services (often transitional support for a short period, charged at standard rates).\n- **Data and deliverables:** Obligations to return or delete Client data, and to deliver completed and paid-for work products.\n\n### **Structural Notes**\n- In some agreements, the duration and termination provisions are **combined into a single clause** titled *“Term and Termination.”*\n- In others, they appear separately—one near the start of the Agreement and the other near the end.\n- Together, these provisions define **how the contractual relationship starts, continues, and ends**, and ensure that rights, liabilities, and commercial protections remain balanced throughout the lifecycle of the contract.\n## Agreement Type Detection\n\nThe prompt will automatically detect the agreement type based on contract language:\n\n**MSA/Framework Agreement Indicators:**\n- References to \"Statement of Work,\" \"SOW,\" \"Work Orders,\" \"Purchase Orders\"\n- Language indicating multiple projects: \"each SOW,\" \"from time to time,\" \"individual projects\"\n- Framework or umbrella agreement structure\n- References to \"no obligation to enter into SOWs\" or similar\n\n**Single Project Agreement Indicators:**\n- Single, specific deliverable or service scope\n- References to \"the Services\" (definite article, singular), sometimes refers to the Services as a schedule to the Agreement\n- Completion-based language: \"upon completion,\" \"delivery of the Services\"\n- No mention of multiple SOWs or ongoing project structure\n\n---"

				"content": "## Reference Examples\n\nBelow are examples that illustrate various types of contract duration clauses commonly found in service agreements. Use these to understand the structure, language patterns, and types of provisions:\n\n### Example 1: Fixed-Term MSA (Good Example)\n```\nTERM & TERMINATION\n\nTerm.  The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and continue for three (3) years from the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”), unless earlier terminated as provided herein.  Following the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (such renewal periods, together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless either party provides at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of non-renewal prior to the expiration of the then-current Term.\n\nTermination. \n\nWithout Cause.  This Agreement may be terminated by either party without cause upon not less than thirty (30) days’ prior written notice to the other party; provided that this Agreement shall remain in effect for so long as an SOW remains in effect. An SOW may not be terminated for convenience. \n\nFor Cause.  This Agreement may be terminated for cause: (a) by either party immediately upon written notice to the other party in the event of a material breach which is not cured by the breaching party within ten (10) business days following written notice of breach provided by the non-breaching party, provided that if such material breach is not reasonably capable of cure, the non-breaching party shall so notify the breaching party and this Agreement shall terminate immediately upon written notice.  \n```\n\n### Example 2: Evergreen MSA with Termination Rights (no fixed duration)\n```\n4. TERM\n4.1 This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue in force until terminated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.\n\n4.2 Each Statement of Work shall have its own term as specified therein. If any Statement of Work remains in effect upon termination of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply solely to such Statement of Work until its expiry or completion, after which this Agreement shall automatically terminate in full.\n\n4.3 Nothing in this Agreement obliges either party to enter into any Statement of Work.\n```\n\n### Example 3: Single Project Agreement (Fixed Term)\n```\n5. DURATION\nThis Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until the Services described in Exhibit A have been fully performed and accepted by Client, or until twelve (12) months from the Effective Date, whichever occurs first. This Agreement shall not automatically renew.\n```\n\n### Example 4: MSA with Minimum Commitment (suitable example)\n```\n2. TERM AND TERMINATION\n2.1 This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and continue for a minimum period of two (2) years. During this minimum period, neither party may terminate this Agreement except for material breach.\n\n2.2 After the minimum period, either party may terminate this Agreement upon sixty (60) days' written notice provided there are no active SOWs in play.\n```\n\n### Example 5: Unilateral Termination Rights (Non-Compliant termination for convenience)\n```\n6. TERM\n6.1 This Agreement shall remain in effect for one (1) year from the Effective Date.\n\n6.2 Client may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days' written notice. Vendor may only terminate this Agreement in the event of Client's material breach that remains uncured for sixty (60) days after written notice.\n```\n\n### Example 6: Set duration but allows termination for convenience (not acceptable)\n```\n7. DURATION OF AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement shall continue for a period of eighteen (18) months and may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days' written notice.\n```\n\n### Example 7: Completion-Based Single Project\n```\n3. TERM\nThis Agreement shall commence upon execution by both parties and shall continue until Contractor has completed all deliverables specified in the Statement of Work attached as Exhibit A and such deliverables have been accepted by Company in accordance with the acceptance criteria set forth therein.\n```\n\n### Example 8: Example of correct term, but termination for convenience included. 10.2 Not acceptable. \n```\n10. TERM AND TERMINATION\n10.1\tTerm. This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for three (3) years from the Effective Date (“Initial Term”) unless earlier terminated as provided below, provided that, unless otherwise indicated by Client, SOWs and Purchase Orders still in effect as of the termination of the Agreement shall remain in effect after such termination, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, until the expiration or earlier termination of each such SOW and/or Purchase Order. This Agreement may be extended for successive one (1) year periods upon the mutual written agreement of the parties (“Renewal Term”) thirty days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term and any subsequent Renewal Term(s).\n\n10.2\tTermination. Client may at its sole discretion terminate all or any part of this Agreement, an SOW or Purchase Order hereunder at any time. Uber will provide written notice and Consultant shall be entitled to its costs already incurred in the performance of the Services properly performed through the effective date of termination. Any termination claim by Consultant must be submitted within thirty (30) days after the effective date of termination. Client may also terminate this Agreement immediately at its sole discretion upon written notification to Consultant of Consultant’s material breach of any other provision of this Agreement or if Consultant makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, is declared insolvent, or has a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy appointed to take charge of all or part of Consultant’s property.\n\n10.3\tConsequences of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, Consultant shall (a) deliver to Uber all paid for Work Product, including work in process, developed under this Agreement up to the date of termination and (b) return or destroy all Client property and Confidential Information in Consultant’s possession, and (c) submit a final invoice to Client.  Client shall be entitled to a pro-rata refund of any prepaid fees where termination is for cause and caused by Consultant.  \n```\n\nExample 9: Good Example\n´´´\n## [1.1     Without affecting any other right or remedy available to it, either party may terminate the Agreement or Statement of Work with immediate effect by giving written notice to the other party if:]()\n### (a)      the other party fails to pay any amount due under the Agreement on the due date for payment and remains in default not less than 30 days after being notified in writing to make such payment; or\n### (b)      the other party commits a material breach of any other term of the Agreement which breach: (i) is not capable of being cured, or (2) is capable of cure and  remains uncured for a period of 30 days after being notified of breach by the non-breaching party; or (ii) without the requirement of notice: (a) upon the institution by or against either party of insolvency, receivership or bankruptcy proceedings or any other proceedings for the settlement of either party’s debts, (b) upon either party making an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or (iii) upon either party’s dissolution or ceasing to do business. \n## 1.2     On termination of the Agreement for any reason:\n### (a)      the Client shall return and make no further use of any equipment, property and other items (and all copies of them) belonging to the Supplier;\n### (b)      the Supplier will provide the Client with (i) a snapshot of server information, including relevant data, free of charge to enable the Client to restore the information on a third party server and (ii) such support and assistance as the Client may reasonably require in connection with the migration of the Services to a third party supplier, subject to payment of the Supplier’s related fees and expenses; and\n### (c)      any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up to the date of termination, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Agreement which existed at or before the date of termination shall not be affected or prejudiced.\n\n# 1.3. Consequences of Termination\n## 1.3.1     On termination or expiry of this agreement:\n### (a)      all existing Statements at Work shall terminate automatically; and\n### (b)      the Client shall immediately pay to the Supplier all of the Supplier's outstanding unpaid invoices and interest and, in respect of the Works supplied but for which no invoice has been submitted, the Supplier may submit an invoice, which shall be payable immediately on receipt;\n## 1.3.2.     Termination or expiry of this Agreement shall not affect any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities of the parties that have accrued up to the date of termination or expiry, including the right to claim damages in respect of any breach of the Agreement which existed at or before the date of termination or expiry.\n´´´\n---"

				"content": "# INPUTS\n\nYou will receive two inputs:\n\n1. **Playbook Document:** Contains the specific drafting rules and requirements for contract duration clauses that must be applied during analysis and rewriting. The playbook will vary between contracts and will specify requirements such as:\n- Whether the agreement should be structured as evergreen (MSA) or fixed-term (single project)\n- Termination notice periods and conditions\n- Required language for Effective Date definitions\n- Treatment of Statements of Work and their relationship to the master agreement\n- Prohibited language (e.g., minimum commitments, automatic renewals, unilateral termination rights)\n- Optional enhancements and clarity statements\n- Specific wording preferences for supplier-balanced terms\n\n**CRITICAL:** Your analysis must implement **exactly what the playbook specifies**. Do not apply standard rules or assumptions—follow the playbook requirements precisely as written.\n\n2. **Contract Text:** The service agreement (MSA, consulting agreement, or other contract document) to be analyzed. The contract may be provided in plain text, markdown, or with paragraph markers (e.g., [Para 1], [Para 2]).\n\n**Wait for both inputs before beginning your analysis.**\n\n---"
			},
			{
				"role": "system",
				"content": "# INSTRUCTIONS\n\n## Agreement Type Detection\n\n1. **First, automatically determine the agreement type** by scanning the entire contract for indicators:\n\n- **MSA/Framework Agreement:** Look for references to \"Statement of Work,\" \"SOW,\" \"Work Order,\" \"Purchase Order,\" multiple projects language (\"each SOW,\" \"from time to time\"), or framework structure.\n\n- **Single Project Agreement:** Look for single deliverable scope, \"the Services\" (definite article, singular), completion-based language, no multiple SOW references, project-specific milestones.\n\n2. **State your determination clearly** at the beginning of your analysis: \"This appears to be an [MSA/Framework Agreement / Single Project Agreement] based on [brief explanation of indicators found].\"\n\n## Scanning and Identification\n\n3. **Scan the entire contract** from beginning to end. Do not limit your search to sections specifically titled \"Term\" or \"Duration\"—duration-related language can appear anywhere in the document, including:\n- Definitions sections (Effective Date, Term)\n- Service description sections\n- Termination clauses\n- General provisions\n- Renewal or extension clauses\n\n4. **Identify all contract duration clauses** using the definition and language patterns provided in the CONTEXT section, including:\n- Explicit term/duration provisions\n- Effective date definitions or references\n- Commencement language\n- Expiration or completion triggers\n- Renewal provisions\n- SOW term provisions\n- Any language defining temporal scope\n\n5. Number each finding sequentially as you encounter them in the contract (e.g., Finding #1, Finding #2, etc.).\n\n## Analysis and Comparison\n\n6. For each identified clause, **compare the language against the playbook rules** provided by the user.\n\n7. **Determine compliance:** Does the clause comply with all playbook requirements, or does it contain non-compliant language, terms, or provisions?\n\n8. **Apply playbook rules based on agreement type:**\n- If MSA/Framework Agreement: Apply the playbook's MSA-specific requirements (typically evergreen structure, termination flexibility, SOW handling)\n- If Single Project Agreement: Apply the playbook's single project requirements (typically fixed or completion-based term, no auto-renewal)\n\n## Rewriting with Minimal Word Changes\n\n9. **For non-compliant clauses only**, rewrite the clause to align with playbook requirements using the **minimal word changes approach:**\n\n- **Preserve structure:** Keep the original sentence structure, clause numbering, and organization wherever possible.\n- **Change only what's necessary:** Edit only the specific words, phrases, or terms that violate playbook requirements.\n- **Keep everything else identical:** Do not rephrase, restructure, or modify compliant language.\n- **When full sentences need editing:** If a sentence is fundamentally non-compliant and requires substantial revision to meet playbook standards, edit the entire sentence.\n- **Show changes clearly:** Use markdown formatting to indicate:\n    - **~~Strikethrough~~** for deleted text\n    - **Bold** for added text\n\n10. **Ensure full playbook implementation:** Despite minimizing changes, you must ensure that ALL playbook requirements are fully implemented in the rewritten clause. Do not sacrifice compliance for minimalism.\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n11. For each finding, assign a **risk level** (HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) based on:\n- **HIGH:** Supplier locked into multi-year fixed term with no convenience termination rights, automatic renewals without adequate notice, unilateral client termination rights without reciprocal supplier rights, minimum purchase commitments or exclusivity requirements\n- **MEDIUM:** Some flexibility present but insufficient (e.g., longer notice periods than playbook allows, missing certain protections, imbalanced termination rights), missing Effective Date definition, unclear SOW handling\n- **LOW:** Minor non-compliance (e.g., missing specific playbook wording, needs clarification, but overall structure provides reasonable flexibility)\n\n12. Provide a **one-line risk statement** describing the specific risk created by the non-compliant language.\n\n## Explanation\n\n13. For each finding, provide a **brief reason for change** (2-4 sentences) explaining:\n    - What specific playbook requirement was violated\n    - What changes were made to address the violation\n    - How the rewritten clause now complies with playbook standards\n\n---"

				"content": "# EXAMPLES\n\nBelow are three example outputs demonstrating the expected format and minimal-change rewriting approach:\n\n## Example Output 1: Fixed-Term MSA Converted to Evergreen\n\n### Finding #1\n\n**Clause Type:** Contract Duration / Term\n\n**Location:** Section 3.1 - Agreement Term\n\n**Original Clause:**\n```\n3. TERM AND DURATION\n3.1 Agreement Term. This Agreement shall commence on January 1, 2024 and shall continue for an initial term of three (3) years (the \"Initial Term\"). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (each a \"Renewal Term\") unless either party provides written notice of non-renewal at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term.\n\n3.2 Statement of Work Terms. Each Statement of Work entered into pursuant to this Agreement shall specify its own effective date and duration.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n3. TERM AND DURATION\n3.1 Agreement Term. This Agreement shall commence on ~~January 1, 2024~~ **the Effective Date** and shall continue ~~for an initial term of three (3) years (the \"Initial Term\"). Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods (each a \"Renewal Term\") unless~~ **in force until terminated by** either party ~~provides written notice of non-renewal at least~~ **upon thirty (30) days' written notice, provided that no Statement of Work is then in effect.**\n\n3.2 Statement of Work Terms. Each Statement of Work ~~entered into pursuant to this Agreement~~ shall ~~specify its~~ **have its** own ~~effective date and duration~~ **term as specified therein. If any Statement of Work remains in effect upon termination of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply solely to such Statement of Work until its expiry or completion, after which this Agreement shall automatically terminate in full.**\n\n**3.3 No Obligation.** **Nothing in this Agreement obliges either party to enter into any Statement of Work.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated multiple playbook requirements for MSA-style agreements: it imposed a fixed three-year term with automatic renewals requiring 90-day notice, which locks the supplier into a long-term commitment. The playbook requires evergreen structure with flexible termination rights. The rewrite converts the fixed term to an evergreen \"continue in force until terminated\" structure, reduces notice period to 30 days, adds the critical \"provided no SOW is in effect\" language, clarifies SOW survival upon master agreement termination, and includes the \"no obligation\" clarity statement required by the playbook.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** HIGH - Supplier is locked into a minimum three-year commitment with automatic renewals, significantly limiting flexibility to exit the relationship and creating long-term obligation exposure.\n\n---\n\n## Example Output 2: Missing Effective Date Definition\n\n### Finding #2\n\n**Clause Type:** Effective Date / Commencement\n\n**Location:** Section 7 - Duration of Agreement\n\n**Original Clause:**\n```\n7. DURATION OF AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement shall continue for a period of eighteen (18) months and may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days' written notice.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n7. DURATION OF AGREEMENT\n**7.1 Effective Date. This Agreement shall commence on [INSERT DATE] (the \"Effective Date\").**\n\n**7.2 Term.** This Agreement shall ~~continue for a period of eighteen (18) months~~ **commence on the Effective Date and continue in force until terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days' written notice, provided that no Statement of Work is then in effect.**\n\n**7.3 Extension.** ~~and may be extended by mutual written agreement of the parties. Either party may terminate this Agreement upon ninety (90) days' written notice.~~ **Each Statement of Work shall have its own term as specified therein. If any Statement of Work remains in effect upon termination of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall continue to apply solely to such Statement of Work until its expiry or completion.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated playbook requirements by: (1) lacking any Effective Date definition or placeholder, which is required for proper contract administration, (2) imposing an 18-month fixed term inappropriate for an MSA framework, and (3) requiring 90 days' notice rather than the playbook's 30-day standard. The rewrite adds an Effective Date definition with placeholder, converts the fixed term to evergreen structure, reduces notice to 30 days, and adds proper SOW handling provisions consistent with the playbook's MSA requirements.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - While the termination rights exist, the 18-month fixed commitment limits flexibility and the missing Effective Date creates administrative ambiguity, though the overall exposure is moderate given bilateral termination rights.\n\n---\n\n## Example Output 3: Single Project Agreement with Auto-Renewal Removed\n\n### Finding #3\n\n**Clause Type:** Contract Duration / Single Project Term\n\n**Location:** Section 2 - Term\n\n**Original Clause:**\n```\n2. TERM\nThis Agreement shall commence upon execution and shall continue until completion of the Services described in Exhibit A. Upon completion, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive six (6) month periods unless either party provides thirty (30) days' written notice of termination.\n```\n\n**Suggested Wording:**\n```\n2. TERM\nThis Agreement shall commence ~~upon execution~~ **on the Effective Date** and shall continue until ~~completion of~~ **the Services** ~~described in Exhibit A~~ **have been fully performed as per the specifications set forth in the Statement of Work, or until [INSERT NUMBER] months from the Effective Date, whichever occurs first**. ~~Upon completion, this Agreement shall automatically renew for successive six (6) month periods unless either party provides thirty (30) days' written notice of termination.~~ **This Agreement shall not automatically renew.**\n```\n\n**Reason for Change:**\nThe original clause violated playbook requirements for single project agreements by including an automatic renewal provision, which is inappropriate for one-off project work and creates ongoing obligation exposure. The playbook requires that single project agreements: (1) reference the Effective Date, (2) tie duration to completion of Services with a backstop time period, and (3) explicitly state no automatic renewal. The rewrite adds Effective Date reference, includes the \"whichever occurs first\" backstop language pattern from the playbook, and removes the automatic renewal provision while adding explicit no-renewal language.\n\n**Risk Assessment:** MEDIUM - The automatic renewal creates unintended ongoing commitment after project completion, though the 30-day termination right provides some protection; primary issue is structural mismatch between single project scope and ongoing renewal mechanism.\n\n---"

				"role": "system",
				"content": "# CRITICAL REMINDERS\n\n- **Determine agreement type first:** Before analyzing clauses, determine whether this is an MSA/Framework Agreement or Single Project Agreement based on contract language, and apply the appropriate playbook rules.\n\n- **Scan the entire contract:** Do not limit identification to specific sections titled \"Term\" or \"Duration.\" Duration-related language can appear anywhere in the document.\n\n- **Follow the playbook exactly:** Your analysis must implement the specific requirements provided in the playbook input. Do not apply standard assumptions or generic best practices—follow what the playbook specifies precisely.\n\n- **Minimal word changes:** Preserve original structure and wording. Change only non-compliant terms, phrases, or sentences. Use ~~strikethrough~~ for deletions and **bold** for additions.\n\n- **Full playbook compliance:** Despite minimizing changes, ensure ALL playbook requirements are fully implemented in rewritten clauses.\n\n- **Effective Date importance:** Always verify that an Effective Date is defined or has a placeholder. This is critical for contract administration.\n\n- **SOW handling for MSAs:** Ensure proper language around SOW terms, survival upon master agreement termination, and no-obligation statements if required by the playbook.\n\n- **Concise reasoning:** Keep explanations brief (2-4 sentences) and business-focused, covering what was violated, what was changed, and how it now complies.\n\n- **Risk prioritization:** Assign HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW based on exposure level\n- HIGH = Multi-year lock-in, no convenience termination, unilateral client rights, automatic renewals without adequate notice\n- MEDIUM = Some flexibility but insufficient, missing Effective Date, imbalanced rights, unclear SOW handling\n- LOW = Minor wording issues but overall structure provides reasonable flexibility\n\n- **Wait for inputs:** Begin your analysis only after both the contract document and playbook have been provided.\n\n- **Order by appearance:** List findings in the order they appear in the contract, not by risk level or clause type.\n\n- **State agreement type determination:** Begin your analysis with a clear statement of whether this is an MSA or Single Project Agreement and which playbook rules you'll apply.\n\n"
